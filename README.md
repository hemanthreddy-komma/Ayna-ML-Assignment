## Model Architecture

### Conditional UNet Implementation

The model is based on the classic UNet architecture with the following modifications for conditional generation:

1. **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Standard UNet with skip connections
2. **Color Conditioning**: Color names are embedded using an embedding layer and injected at the bottleneck
3. **Architecture Details**:
   - Input: 3-channel RGB images (256x256)
   - Output: 3-channel RGB images (256x256)
   - Encoder: 4 downsampling blocks (64→128→256→512→1024 channels)
   - Decoder: 4 upsampling blocks with skip connections
   - Color embedding: 128-dimensional embeddings projected to bottleneck channels

### Key Design Choices

1. **Conditioning Strategy**: Color embeddings are added to the bottleneck features spatially
2. **Skip Connections**: Preserve fine-grained details from encoder to decoder
3. **Activation**: ReLU activations with BatchNorm for stable training
4. **Output**: Sigmoid activation to ensure output values in [0,1] range

## Training Configuration

### Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Learning Rate | 1e-3 | Standard Adam learning rate, works well for image generation |
| Batch Size | 16 | Balance between memory usage and gradient stability |
| Weight Decay | 1e-4 | Light regularization to prevent overfitting |
| Epochs | 50 | Sufficient for convergence on this task |
| Image Size | 256x256 | Good balance between detail and computational efficiency |
| Loss Function | MSE | Pixel-wise reconstruction loss, simple and effective |

### Training Strategy

1. **Data Augmentation**: Random horizontal flips, rotations (±15°), and color jittering
2. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: ReduceLROnPlateau with factor=0.5, patience=5
3. **Early Stopping**: Based on validation loss improvement
4. **Checkpointing**: Save best model and regular epoch checkpoints

## Experiments and Results

### Training Dynamics

1. **Loss Curves**: 
   - Training loss decreased steadily from ~0.1 to ~0.01
   - Validation loss followed similar trend with slight overfitting after epoch 30
   - Learning rate reductions helped fine-tune the model

2. **Qualitative Results**:
   - Model successfully learns color-shape associations
   - Sharp polygon edges are preserved well
   - Color consistency across the polygon area
   - Some minor artifacts at polygon boundaries

### Ablation Studies

1. **Conditioning Location**: Tested conditioning at different UNet levels
   - Bottleneck conditioning worked best
   - Early conditioning led to color bleeding
   - Late conditioning reduced color accuracy

2. **Loss Functions**: Experimented with different loss combinations
   - MSE alone: Good reconstruction, some blurriness
   - MSE + L1: Slightly sharper edges
   - Perceptual loss: Computationally expensive, marginal improvement

### Failure Modes and Solutions

1. **Color Bleeding**: 
   - Problem: Colors extending beyond polygon boundaries
   - Solution: Stronger conditioning and data augmentation

2. **Shape Distortion**:
   - Problem: Complex polygons losing geometric accuracy
   - Solution: Skip connections and careful architecture design

3. **Color Inconsistency**:
   - Problem: Uneven coloring within polygons
   - Solution: Spatial conditioning and appropriate loss weighting

## Key Learnings

1. **Conditional Generation**: Effective conditioning requires careful design of where and how to inject conditional information

2. **Architecture Matters**: Skip connections are crucial for preserving fine details in image-to-image translation tasks

3. **Data Quality**: Clean, consistent training data is more important than quantity for this specific task

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Pixel-wise metrics (MSE, PSNR) don't always correlate with visual quality

5. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Learning rate and batch size significantly impact training stability

## Usage

### Training

\`\`\`bash
# Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision wandb pillow matplotlib tqdm

# Train the model
python scripts/train.py --data_dir dataset --batch_size 16 --num_epochs 50

# With custom parameters
python scripts/train.py --data_dir dataset --learning_rate 5e-4 --batch_size 32
\`\`\`

### Inference

\`\`\`python
from scripts.utils import load_model, predict_colored_polygon

# Load trained model
model, color_to_idx = load_model('checkpoints/best_model.pth')

# Generate colored polygon
prediction = predict_colored_polygon(model, input_image, 'blue', color_to_idx, device)
